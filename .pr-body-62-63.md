## Summary

This PR implements two backend features for MindRobo call management:

1. **Ring Timeout Configuration** (#62) - allows businesses to configure call forwarding behavior
2. **Call Recordings Wiring** (#63) - automatically downloads and stores call recordings in Azure Blob

## Changes

### Ring Timeout Configuration (#62)

**Database:**
- Added `ring_timeout_seconds` field to Business model (default: "20")

**Endpoints:**
- `PUT /api/v1/businesses/{id}/call-settings` - update ring timeout and owner phone
- `GET /api/v1/businesses/{id}/call-settings` - retrieve current settings

**Features:**
- Allows customization of how long to ring before forwarding to owner
- Updates owner phone number for call forwarding
- Returns sensible defaults (20 seconds) if not configured

### Call Recordings - Azure Blob Wiring (#63)

**Webhook Integration:**
- Modified `save_call()` in `app/services/calls.py` to check for `recording_url` in Retell webhook payload
- Downloads recording from Retell's `recording_url`
- Uploads to Azure Blob Storage via existing `blob_storage.py` service
- Saves Azure Blob URL to `calls.recording_url` field (field already existed)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/calls/{id}/recording` - returns accessible recording URL for playback

**Environment Variables:**
- Uses existing `AZURE_BLOB_CONNECTION_STRING` from environment (no hardcoding)

**Error Handling:**
- Logs but does not fail the webhook if recording upload fails
- Returns 404 if no recording available for a call
- Gracefully skips upload if Azure credentials not configured

## Migration

Run migration to add ring_timeout_seconds field:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## QA Checklist

### Ring Timeout (#62)
- [ ] Can save ring timeout (PUT endpoint)
- [ ] Can retrieve ring timeout (GET endpoint)
- [ ] Returns default of 20 seconds if not configured
- [ ] Updates owner_phone correctly
- [ ] User can only access their own business settings

### Call Recordings (#63)
- [ ] Recordings are downloaded from Retell when recording_url is present
- [ ] Recordings are uploaded to Azure Blob container "call-recordings"
- [ ] recording_url field is saved to database
- [ ] GET /calls/{id}/recording returns Azure Blob URL
- [ ] Returns 404 when no recording exists
- [ ] Webhook does not fail if recording upload fails (logs error)
- [ ] Gracefully handles missing AZURE_BLOB_CONNECTION_STRING

### General
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Migration runs successfully
- [ ] Authenticated endpoints require valid user token
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for legacy endpoints

## Testing

```bash
# Example: Configure ring timeout
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/v1/businesses/{id}/call-settings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ring_timeout_seconds": 30,
    "owner_phone": "+14155551234"
  }'

# Example: Get call recording
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/calls/abc123/recording \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```
